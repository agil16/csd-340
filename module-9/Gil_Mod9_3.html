        <p class="intro">
            I decided to go back to school to pursue a different career to build a better future for my family. Balancing full-time work, full-time school, and my children's sports is challenging, but I am determined to succeed. It is a journey filled with long nights, early mornings, and countless sacrifices, but I know that every step brings me closer to my goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite my busy schedule, I make time to spend with my kids and family. Family is my motivation and inspiration to keep pushing forward. The sacrifices I make now will create a better life for us all. Seeing my children happy and knowing that I am setting an example for them keeps me going, even when things get overwhelming.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy arts and crafts, mainly scrapbooking and making shirts with my Cricut. These creative outlets allow me to express myself and unwind. Recently, I started getting into puzzles and journaling as a way to cope with life's rough patches. Writing helps me reflect, while puzzles give me a sense of accomplishment and relaxation after a long day.

            My journey requires a lot of <span id="span1">______</span> <button onclick="replaceWord('span1', word1)">Reveal</button>,
            <span id="span2">______</span> <button onclick="replaceWord('span2', word2)">Reveal</button>,
            and a love for <span id="span3">______</span> <button onclick="replaceWord('span3', word3)">Reveal</button>.
            Above all, I strive for <span id="span4">______</span> <button onclick="replaceWord('span4', word4)">Reveal</button> in my life.
